</ul>
<p>Spartacus is...</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Extendable</strong>: Spartacus is designed to be upgradable while maintaining full extendability. You&#39;ll be able to adopt new versions of Spartacus by updating the Spartacus libraries that we will regularly enhance. (In order to ensure that the first release is as extendable and upgradable as we&#39;d like, breaking changes will very likely be introduced up until the 1.0 launch.)</li>
<li><strong>Upgradable</strong>: Spartacus code is published and used as libraries and follows semantic versioning conventions. By using the libraries, Spartacus is upgradable for minor and patch releases.</li>
<li><strong>Progressive</strong>: Spartacus is on a journey to be fully compliant with the Progressive Web Application (PWA) checklist. We aim to add support for all major features of a PWA-enabled storefront, to offer the best possible customer experience regardless of device or location.</li>
<li><strong>Open Source</strong>: Spartacus is open source. It will be continually developed by the SAP Commerce Cloud team, but we are very keen to welcome contributors and to foster an inclusive, active development community for Spartacus. See our <a href="CONTRIBUTING.md">contributing documentation</a> for more information.</li>
<li><strong>Modern</strong>: The Spartacus storefront is part of our exciting new journey towards a customizable-yet-upgradable technology for SAP Commerce Cloud installations. See <a href="https://cx.sap.com/en/products/commerce">SAP Customer Experience</a> for more information about SAP Commerce Cloud.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="requirements">Requirements</h2>
<p>If you are working with Spartacus 4.x, your Angular development environment should include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://angular.io/">Angular CLI</a>: <strong>12.0</strong> or later, &lt; 13.</li>
<li>yarn: v1.15 or later</li>
<li>node.js: The most recent <strong>14.x</strong> version is required. Version 12.x reached end-of-life on April 30, 2022, and is no longer supported by Spartacus. It is strongly recommended that you migrate any existing Spartacus storefronts to Node.js 14 as soon as possible. If there are any issues with Spartacus and Node.js 14, please upgrade to the latest releases. If you continue to experience issues with Node.js 14, create a support ticket with SAP. Spartacus also supports version 16.x of Node.js, but this version is not yet supported in Commerce Cloud in the Public Cloud builder.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are working with Spartacus 3.x, your Angular development environment should include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://angular.io/">Angular CLI</a>: <strong>10.1</strong> or later, &lt; 11.</li>
<li>node.js: 12.16.1 or later, &lt; 13.0. The most recent 12.x version is recommended.</li>
<li>yarn: v1.15 or later</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are working with Spartacus 2.x, your Angular development environment should include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://angular.io/">Angular CLI</a>: <strong>9.1</strong> or later, &lt; 10.</li>
<li>node.js: 10.14.1 or later, &lt; 13.0. The most recent 12.x version is recommended.</li>
<li>yarn: v1.15 or later</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are working with Spartacus 1.x, your Angular development environment should include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://angular.io/">Angular CLI</a>: v8.0.0 or later, &lt; v9.0.0</li>
<li>node.js: v10 or later, &lt; v12</li>
<li>yarn: v1.15 or later</li>
</ul>
<p>For the back end, SAP Commerce Cloud version 1905 or higher is required, and SAP Commerce Cloud version 2005 or newer is recommended.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Some Spartacus features require API endpoints that are only available in newer versions of SAP Commerce Cloud. For more information, see <a href="https://sap.github.io/spartacus-docs/feature-release-versions/">Feature Compatibility</a> in the Spartacus documentation.</p>
<h2 id="download-and-installation">Download and Installation</h2>
<p>To get up and running with Spartacus, the recommended approach is to build your storefront application from ready-made libraries. You can also clone and build from source, but upgrading is not as simple.</p>
<p>Spartacus currently can only be used with a SAP Commerce Cloud instance through Commerce APIs.</p>
<p>To quickly add Spartacus libraries to an Angular application, you can use Spartacus schematics: <code>ng add @spartacus/schematics</code>. This will setup and install Spartacus libraries to your Angular project. Please check the <a href="https://sap.github.io/spartacus-docs/schematics/">official Spartacus schematics documentation</a> for all the prerequisites and instruction on how to use Spartacus schematics.</p>
<p>For complete setup instructions, see <a href="https://sap.github.io/spartacus-docs/building-the-spartacus-storefront-from-libraries/">Building the Spartacus Storefront from Libraries</a>.</p>
<h2 id="customizing-and-extending-spartacus">Customizing and Extending Spartacus</h2>
<p>To maintain our promise of upgradability, the design pattern for Spartacus is for non-core features to be built as feature libraries that add to or change the provided functionality.</p>
<p>When using Spartacus, you build an app that pulls in the Spartacus libraries, which contain the core resources needed to work with SAP Commerce. You then build new features that contain any custom functionality and pages.</p>
<p>Content for Spartacus pages is fetched from the SAP Commerce Cloud CMS (Content Management System), such as logos, links, banners and static pages. We recommend that new content-driven features follow the same pattern to enable Content Managers to modify page content through the CMS tools.</p>
<p>The documentation for customizing and extending Spartacus is still under development and is being released as it becomes available.</p>
<h2 id="spartacus-application-documentation">Spartacus application documentation</h2>
<p>The latest generated documentation for Spartacus application libraries (modules, classes, interfaces, and so on) is hosted here: <a href="https://sap.github.io/spartacus/">https://sap.github.io/spartacus/</a></p>
<p>The application documentation is versioned and it is included on the <strong>Assets</strong> section of every release of each and every Spartacus library. You can download the documentation for a particular version by accessing the <strong>Assets</strong> section of any Spartacus library from that particular release, and then clicking on <code>docs.tar.gz</code> or <code>docs.zip</code>. To find the <strong>Assets</strong> folder for a particular library, access the <a href="https://github.com/SAP/spartacus/releases">Released Libraries for Spartacus</a>, click on the link for the library you are interested in, and scroll to the bottom of the page.</p>
<p>For example, to download the application documentation for the 3.4.0 release, you could access the <strong>Assets</strong> folder of the <code>@spartacus/storefront@3.4.0</code> library <a href="https://github.com/SAP/spartacus/releases/tag/storefront-3.4.0">here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The 1.x and 2.x releases of the Spartacus libraries work only with SAP Commerce versions 1905 and 2005. Certain features, such as cancellations and returns, are only available with SAP Commerce 2005, because the necessary OCC API support is only available in SAP Commerce 2005.</p>
<h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>
<p>When 1.0.0 is released, it is recommended to use SAP Commerce 1905. Spartacus works with Release 1808 and 1811 of SAP Commerce Cloud, with some limitations.</p>
<p>Spartacus is also being updated so that it works well with upcoming releases of SAP Commerce Cloud. This means that certain features of Spartacus may only work with unreleased future editions of SAP Commerce Cloud. This will be noted as we release new versions of Spartacus.</p>
<h2 id="known-issues">Known Issues</h2>
<p>Known issues are documented in the GitHub issue tracking system.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-obtain-support">How to Obtain Support</h2>
